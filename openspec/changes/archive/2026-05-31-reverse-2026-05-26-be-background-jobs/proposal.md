# Reverse-spec — Background job execution

Retroactively specifies the observed behavior of 2 method(s) implementing scheduled CRM background jobs. The code already exists and is exercised in the running app — this change documents its true capabilities as REQs and annotates each method with an `@spec` reference. No code logic changes.

## Affected code units

- `lib/BackgroundJob/CallbackOverdueJob.php::run`
- `lib/BackgroundJob/QueueOverflowJob.php::run`

## Approach

- Read each implementation; extract observable inputs/outputs and domain meaning.
- Cluster methods with shared observable behavior under a small set of REQs (capability-level, observed-not-aspirational).
- Annotate each method's docblock with `@spec openspec/.../tasks.md#task-N` pointing at its task.
